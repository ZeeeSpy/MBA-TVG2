*ahem*
Yes well, me and Twitch Chat saw your brain playing Tekken and we decided to join it for a couple of games.
TwitchChat had to leave because it was almost his bed time.
I played against your brain a little longer.
It got really intense, we were neck and neck in our first to 20! 19-19!
Luckily I managed to edge it out and win the 39th game.
"Ez Clap" as TwitchChat would say.
