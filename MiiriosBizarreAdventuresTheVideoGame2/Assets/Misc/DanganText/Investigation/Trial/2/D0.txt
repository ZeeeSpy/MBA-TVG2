That's bullshit.
My brain is well known for only drinking highland spring.
Every drop of Highland Spring comes from the majestic Ochil Hills.
Where it is carefully drawn from protected land.  
They keep the land free from any kind of pollution, pesticides or habitation to ensure the water they draw is as pure as can be.
