Hey Miirio, how are you enjoying Season 4? You like the new <color=yellow>netcode and rollback?</color>
Want to know a little secret? We didn't change anything at all. All we did is replace the image used for 1,2 and 3 bar with the 5 bar image.
Also do you like <color=yellow>new move?</color> We asked a total of ZERO (0) Lee players for input.
Actually come to think of it, we didn't ask anyone for input other than our Tekken Producer. 
He's a high rank you know.
