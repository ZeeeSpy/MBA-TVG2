Good morning, everyone! It is I, <color=yellow>MonoJerry</color> your headmaster.
Now, ah, make no mistake-you few students, so full of potential, represent the  <color=yellow>Miirio Lore</color>.
And to procect such splendid lore...
...you will all live a communal life together <color=yellow>solely within the confines of this school.</color>.
Everyone will live in harmony together, and adhere to the rules and regulations of the school.
As Headmaster, I've crafted a <color=yellow>special clause</color> for those of you who would like to leave!
Now, let me tell you about this fun little rule.
As I mentioned, in order to maintain an enviroment of harmony here, we rely on a communal lifestyle.
And if someone were to disrupt that harmony, they and they alone would be allowed to leave the school.
Yada yada yada, I'm sure you've played something like this before and this is enough set up. Meet your fellow classmates.
Buh bye!
