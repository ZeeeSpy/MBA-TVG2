Ah Miirio, our cherished partner. So MonoJerry brought you here too huh?
Sorry for killing song request, and <color=yellow>telling you to delete all your vods and clips.</color>
I'm sure those hundreads of hours of vods meant nothing to you anyway, they didn't mean anything to us.
Oh by the way, we've noticed how a lot of your viewers donate money via paypal. Could you ask them to buy bits instead please. Thank you.
Please don't do anything hasty and murder me, it would be pretty obvious.
