Ah Miirio, our cherished partner.
Sorry for killing song request, and <color=yellow>telling you to delete all your vods and clips.</color>
I'm sure those hundreads of hours of vods meant nothing to you anyway, they didn't mean anything to us.
Oh by the way, we've noticed how a lot of your viewers donate money via paypal. Could you ask them to buy bits instead please. Thank you.
