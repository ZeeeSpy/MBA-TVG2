Hey Myrow, did you just wake up here too?
You, us and a few other people all just woke up here. We've all been kidnapped by MonoJerry.
It feels like the plot of some weeb investigation game if you ask us. Like Japanese among us or something.
All those years of beating up Jerry have finally made him snap.
Don't worry Miirio XBOXGANG will protect you, you don't need to worry about being killed in here.
While you're here could you please turn off <color=yellow>"I'm 12 btw"</color>.
