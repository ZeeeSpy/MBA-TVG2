Hey Myrow, did you just wake up here too?
You, us and a few other people all just woke up here. We've all been kidnapped.
It feels like the plot of some weeb investigation game if you ask us. Like Japanese among us or something.
While you're here could you please turn off <color=yellow>"I'm 12 btw"</color>.
