Hey Miirio. Long time no talk.
Can't believe MonoJerry locked us up in here.
He really expects one of us to kill someone?
I managed to find some Highland spring here. Thank god.
I can't drink anything else really.
There's a whole gym in here. That's pretty nice. Why couldn't MonoJerry kidnap us before lockdown.
